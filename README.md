# Hey-Day

It's an **annual local event in Auburn** in which all Auburn members are encouraged to **greet** each other and **communicate** together as a one big **family**. This tradition aims to make all **students** feel that they're **heard** and **seen** in campus. It will be celebrated on **10/12** this year. 

To know more about this tradition, please visit [Hey Day!](http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/)
